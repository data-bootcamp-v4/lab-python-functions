Now, let's take it a step further and refactor the code by introducing functions.\n","\n","Follow the steps below to complete the exercise:\n","\n","1. Define a function named `initialize_inventory` that takes `products` as a parameter. Inside the function, implement the code for initializing the inventory dictionary using a loop and user input.\n","\n","2. Define a function named `get_customer_orders` that takes no parameters. Inside the function, implement the code for prompting the user to enter the product names using a loop. The function should return the `customer_orders` set.\n","\n","3. Define a function named `update_inventory` that takes `customer_orders` and `inventory` as parameters. Inside the function, implement the code for updating the inventory dictionary based on the customer orders.\n","\n","4. Define a function named `calculate_order_statistics` that takes `customer_orders` and `products` as parameters. Inside the function, implement the code for calculating the order statistics (total products ordered, and percentage of unique products ordered). The function should return these values.\n","\n","5. Define a function named `print_order_statistics` that takes `order_statistics` as a parameter. Inside the function, implement the code for printing the order statistics.\n","\n","6. Define a function named `print_updated_inventory` that takes `inventory` as a parameter. Inside the function, implement the code for printing the updated inventory.\n","\n","7. Call the functions in the appropriate sequence to execute the program and manage customer orders.\n","\n","Hints for functions:\n","\n","- Consider the input parameters required for each function and their return values.\n","- Utilize function parameters and return values to transfer data between functions.\n","- Test your functions individually to ensure they work correctly.\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"e413101e","metadata":{"id":"e413101e","outputId":"688e796b-6456-4d19-ec57-4fbfdeb78ebb"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["{'t-shirt': 5, 'mug': 5, 'hat': 5, 'book': 5, 'keychain': 5}\n"]}],"source":["products = [\"t-shirt\", \"mug\", \"hat\", \"book\", \"keychain\"]\n","\n","def initialize_inventory(list):\n","\n","    inventory = {}\n","\n","    for key in products:\n","        value = int(input(f\"Value of {key}: \"))\n","        inventory[key] = value\n","\n","    return inventory\n","\n","inventory = initialize_inventory(products)\n","print(inventory)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"5a0a02cb","metadata":{"id":"5a0a02cb","outputId":"daf8de02-cc2a-4d8f-938a-d4498949c6d1"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["You choose mug\n","Your lis of products is {'mug'}\n","You choose hat\n","Your lis of products is {'mug', 'hat'}\n","You choose book\n","Your lis of products is {'book', 'mug', 'hat'}\n"]}],"source":["def get_consumer_orders():\n","    trials = 0\n","    customer_orders = set()\n","\n","    while trials<3:\n","        chosen_product = input(f\"Chose one of these products {products}\")\n","        if chosen_product in products:\n","            customer_orders.add(chosen_product)\n","            print(f\"You choose {chosen_product}\")\n","            print(f\"Your lis of products is {customer_orders}\")\n","            trials += 1\n","        else:\n","            print(f\"{chosen_product} is no in the list of products: {products}\")\n","\n","    return customer_orders\n","\n","consumer_orders = get_consumer_orders()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"14cc3677","metadata":{"id":"14cc3677","outputId":"62c67afa-d7a6-4e3a-f98b-7f8b0a8f7239"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["{'book', 'hat', 'mug'}"]},"execution_count":48,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["consumer_orders"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"29bffa42","metadata":{"id":"29bffa42","outputId":"589519eb-9a38-4056-a5c6-a33df08cdd4d"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["{'t-shirt': 5, 'mug': 4, 'hat': 4, 'book': 4, 'keychain': 5}\n"]}],"source":["def update_inventory(orders,inv):\n","\n","    for order in orders:\n","        inv[order] -= 1\n","\n","    return inv\n","\n","inventory_updated = update_inventory(consumer_orders,inventory)\n","\n","print(inventory_updated)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"22c7720b","metadata":{"id":"22c7720b","outputId":"311d17a2-ffbe-4700-c947-a100e2a38e25"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["'You order 3 products and the percentage of products ordered is 60.0%'"]},"execution_count":50,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["def calculate_order_statistics(customer_orders,products):\n","\n","    orders = len(customer_orders)\n","\n","    percentage = orders/len(products) * 100\n","\n","    return f\"You order {orders} products and the percentage of products ordered is {percentage}%\"\n","\n","calculate_order_statistics(consumer_orders,products)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"a835538c","metadata":{"id":"a835538c","outputId":"111161e9-dff1-46db-ac80-2902d7083ee4"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["{'t-shirt': 5, 'mug': 4, 'hat': 4, 'book': 4, 'keychain': 5}\n"]}],"source":["def print_updated_invetory(inventory):\n","\n","    print(inventory)\n","\n","print_updated_invetory(inventory_updated)\n","\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.13.0"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
